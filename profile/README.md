## 👋 **Welcome to the Laboratory of AI Security Research (LAiSR) **

## 🎤 Who we are? 
Located at Miami University and led by **Dr. Samer Khamaiseh**. **LAiSR** research group is passionate about exploring and addressing the evolving challenges within the realm of AI security. Our AI Research Laboratory is at the forefront of cutting-edge research to fortify AI models against adversarial attacks, enhance their robustness, and ensure their reliability in real-world scenarios.


## ❓ Why **AI securtiy**?
- Emerging Threats: As AI systems become more pervasive, they introduce new vulerabilites such as adversarial attacks and privacy breaches. Our Research group plays a pivotal role in uncovering vulnerabilities and devising robust defenses.
- Safeguarding Critical Systems: AI is increasingly integrated into critical infrastructure, healthcare, finance, and defense. Ensuring the security of these systems is non-negotiable. Rigorous research helps prevent catastrophic failures and protects lives and livelihoods.
- Ethical Implications: AI decisions impact individuals and societies. Bias, fairness, and transparency are ethical concerns. Research informs guidelines and policies that promote responsible AI deployment, minimizing harm and maximizing benefits.


## 🔎 Research Focus
- **Robustness:** We delve into techniques that make AI models resilient to perturbations, adversarial examples, and distribution shifts.
- **Security:** Exploring defenses against attacks, privacy preservation, and secure AI deployment.
- **AI Ethics:** Investigate fairness, bias mitigation, and transparency in AI systems.
