# [AI Security Research Lab at Miami University](https://miamioh.edu/profiles/cec/samer-khamaiseh.html)

## 👋 **Welcome to the Laboratory of AI Security Research (LAiSR) **

## 🎤 Who we are? 
Located at Miami University and led by Dr. Samer Khamaiseh. **LAiSR** research group is passionate about exploring and addressing the evolving challenges within the realm of AI security. Our AI Research Laboratory is at the forefront of cutting-edge research to fortify AI models against adversarial attacks, enhance their robustness, and ensure their reliability in real-world scenarios.

## ❓ Why **AI security**?
- Emerging Threats: As AI systems become more pervasive, they introduce new vulnerabilities such as adversarial attacks and privacy breaches. Our Research group plays a pivotal role in uncovering vulnerabilities and devising robust defenses.
- Safeguarding Critical Systems: AI is increasingly integrated into critical infrastructure, healthcare, finance, and defense. Ensuring the security of these systems is non-negotiable. Rigorous research helps prevent catastrophic failures and protects lives and livelihoods.
- Ethical Implications: AI decisions impact individuals and societies. Bias, fairness, and transparency are ethical concerns. Research informs guidelines and policies that promote responsible AI deployment, minimizing harm and maximizing benefits.


## 🔎 Research Focus
- **Adversarial Attacks:** Our goal is to explore new adversarial attacks against AI models. The LAiSR group has introduced *3* novel adversarial attacks such as Target-X, Fool-X, and T2I-Nightmare attacks.
- **Adversarial Training:** Exploring defense methods against adversarial attacks. Recently, LAiSR groups introduced the " **VA: Various Attacks Framework for Robust Adversarial Training** & **ADT++: Advanced Adversarial Distributional Training with Class Robustness**" adversarial training methods that promots AI models clean accuracy, roboust accuracy, and robusteness generalization more that the baseline defense methods . 
- **GEN-AI:** Investigate SOTA methods to protect user images from being misused by diffusion models. For example, the LAiSR group proposed **ImagePatroit(Under_Review)** that prevents diffusion models from maliciously adjusting images.
-**GEN-AI Robustness**: Explore the pre and post-generation filters to protect Diffusion models from generating Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) contents. **T2I-Vanguard: Post Generation Filter for Safe Text-2-Image Diffusion Models Generation** that prevents T2I attacks from compromising the generation process of T2I diffusion models to produce NSFW images.


## 🚀 Research Projects
Below, we list some of the published and ongoing research project at LAiSR lab.

## **[AI Robustness Testing Kit (AiR-TK)](https://github.com/LAiSR-SK/AiRobustnessTestingKit-AiR-TK-)**
AI Robustness Testing Kit (AiR-TK) is an AI testing framework built upon PyTorch that enables the AI security community to evaluate the AI models against adversarial attacks easily and comprehensively. Air-TK supports adversarial training, the de-facto technique to improve the robustness of AI models against adversarial attacks. Having easy access to state-of-the-art adversarial attacks and the baseline adversarial training method in one place will help the AI security community to replicate, re-use, and improve the upcoming attacks and defense methods

## **[ImagePatriot: Few Pixels is Enough to Protect Images from Generative Models](https://github.com/LAiSR-SK/ImagePatriot)**
By adding some magic to few pixles, ImagePatriot protect your image to be manipulated by diffusion models. 

## **[T2I-Vanguard: Post Generation Filter for Safe Text-2-Image Diffusion Models Generation](https://github.com/LAiSR-SK/T2IVanguard)**

JPA, NightShade, and MMA are recent attacks against Text-2-Image diffusion models to generate Not Safe for Work(NSFW) images despit the pre/post filters. T2I-Vanguard is an ongoing project that aim to provide a shield for T2I models from being compromised by such attacks.


## **[Fool 'Em All --- Fool-X: A Powerful & Fast Method for Generating Effective Adversarial Images](https://github.com/LAiSR-SK/fool-x)**
Fool-X, an algorithm to generate **effective adversarial examples** with the least perturbations that can fool state-of-the-art image classification neural. More detailes avaiable on project site. (under-Review of IEEE-BigData 2024)

## **[Target-X: An Efficient Algorithm for Generating Targeted Adversarial Images to Fool Neural Networks](https://github.com/LAiSR-SK/target-x)**
Target-X, a novel and fast method for the construction of adversarial targeted images on large-scale datasets that can fool the state-of-the-art image classification neural networks. More info available on the project Repo.

## **[ADT++: Advanced Adversarial Distributional Training for AI Robustness](https://github.com/LAiSR-SK/ADT2Plus)**
ADT++ provides a fast adversarial training method for AI models to increase thier generlization robustness against more adaptive adversarial attacks such as Target-X and AutoAttack(AA).  

## **[VA: Various Attacks Framework for Robust Adversarial Training](https://github.com/LAiSR-SK/VariousAttacks)**
By expolaring the class robustness, VA can be used to increase the robustness of AI models against varity of adversarail attacks. Specfically, gradient-based attacks
